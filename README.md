## Just Another Language (JAL) Visual Studio Code Extension README


JAL ([Just another Language](https://justanotherlanguage.org)) is an open source programming language for 8 bit PIC microcontrollers.
It was originally created by Wouter Van Ooijen and later rewritten as JALV2 by Kyle York.

Current version of JAL compiler and libraries are maintained by [Jallib](https://github.com/jallib/) team.

JAL had jaledit as its IDE for a long long time, almost from the begining of JALV2. It worked pretty well on Windows but was not updated since 2010.
Being its author I felt VSCode might be a pretty good IDE which can be extended using its  extension framework.

It's a big learning curve for me as it was developed in Delphi whereas vscode works with node/Javascript/Typescript.
Will try to implement all the features of jaledit in this extension.


## Features
 
 * Extremely fast loading/saving of the largest jal files
 * VSCode features like commenting, searching, file explorer 
 * Git support within vscode 
 * Builtin comparison tool
 * Auto completion
