## Just Another Language(JAL) Visual Studio Code Extension README

JAL had jaledit for a long long time almost from the begining of JALV2. It worked pretty well on windows but was not updated since 2010.
Being its author I felt VSCode might be a pretty good IDE which can be extended using its  extension framework.

Its a big learning curve for me as it was developed in Delphi whereas vscode works with node/Javascript/Typescript.
Its a work in progress and hope to get all the features of Jaledit working here with this extension.
